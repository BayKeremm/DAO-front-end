Front-end code is taken from: https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/youtube-tutorials

With this front-end you are able to:
    - Create a membership proposal
    - Sponsor a proposal
    - Vote on a proposal
    - Process a proposal
    - See the members of the DAO
    - See the recent proposals

Problems I had: 
    
    1. Submitting proposal with different accounts
        - This was due to other accounts not having the newly created ERC20 token. 
            When token is deployed, it is minted on the account that deployed it. 
    
    2. Not being able to vote and process a proposal
        - This was due to having too long period duration. 
            I decreased it and deployed the contracts again and 
            it solved the waiting problem 
    
    3. Not being able to vote with a member of the DAO
        - This is due to not having shares, which means in the application
            the member did not request shares. No shares no voting rights
    
    4. To be able to process a proposal, every proposal preeceding it must be processed,
        otherwise you get an error.
    
    5. Smart contract calls that have a sort of transfer needs to have the allowance from the account to 
        the DAO to work. Otherwise you get an error even though you have bsufficient balance.
    
    6. You need to get the signer from the contract and before calling any method of the contract you have to connect 
        the signer to it. This makes sure msg.sender in solidity code is the one you select in metamask.
